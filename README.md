# Bridging the Gap: Infant Mortality in Rich vs. Poor Nations

This project presents an interactive data analytics dashboard focused on the disparity in infant mortality rates between the world's 15 richest and 15 poorest countries. The dashboard aims to highlight the impact of socio-economic inequality on child survival and explore how balanced resource allocation could help narrow this gap.

## How AI Was Used

This project was built with continuous support from AI tools, particularly ChatGPT. AI assisted in:
- Writing Python and Streamlit code
- Debugging deployment issues
- Structuring UX and visualizations
- Creating and editing written content
- Generating README, documentation, and presentation summaries

---

## Challenges Using AI

- Interpreting AI-generated code without prior coding experience
- Adapting solutions to specific project structures
- Understanding Streamlit deployment processes and troubleshooting errors
- Balancing automation with personal learning and critical thinking

---

## Benefits of AI

- Accelerated learning in Python and data visualization
- Helped overcome time and cognitive limitations due to health conditions
- Enabled creation of a professional dashboard with limited technical background
- Provided explanations and alternatives in real-time

---

## Ethical Considerations

- All data is sourced from public, reputable sources (e.g. World Bank)
- No private or sensitive data was used
- AI contributions are clearly documented
- The project avoids political bias or cultural stereotyping
- Attribution is given where necessary and all work is original or AI-assisted with review

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**
- **World Bank API / CSV data sources**
- **Git & GitHub for version control**
- **AI support from ChatGPT**

---

## UX and Accessibility

- Simple navigation and layout
- Large readable fonts and clear color contrasts
- Mobile-responsive design via Streamlit
- Descriptive headings and consistent visual structure
